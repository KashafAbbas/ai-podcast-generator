HOST: Welcome to "TechTalk"! I'm your host, Rachel, and today we have AI expert Dr. Lee discussing the future of AI. How do you think AI will change our daily lives in the next decade?

GUEST: We'll see AI seamlessly integrated into our daily routines, from personalized health advice to smart home automation, making our lives more efficient and convenient.

HOST: That sounds exciting! What are some potential risks or downsides we should be aware of as AI becomes more prevalent?

GUEST: One concern is job displacement, as AI takes over certain tasks, but we must also consider the potential for AI to be misused, such as in cyber attacks or biased decision-making.

HOST: Those are important considerations. How do you think we can balance the benefits of AI with the need for regulation and oversight?

GUEST: Governments, industries, and civil society must work together to establish clear guidelines and standards for AI development and deployment, ensuring transparency and accountability.
